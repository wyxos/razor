# Razor

**Razor** is a self-hosted server management panel for developers and hobbyists.
Run apps, manage services, deploy with ease — all without subscriptions or lock-in.

---

## 🚀 Why Razor?

**Razor** gives you full control over your server. Install it on your **Pi5**, **VPS**, or **cloud instance** and get:

* Clean, fast UI for managing deployments
* Laravel-based backend with Vue-powered frontend
* Host Laravel apps, custom PHP sites, or static content
* Per-app PHP versions, custom Composer use
* Supervisor and cron management built-in
* No vendor, no BS. Just your server, your rules.

---

## ⚙️ Core Features

* One-command install on fresh Ubuntu
* VueJS UI with full API access
* Multiple PHP version support
* Composer per PHP version
* Process manager: Supervisor, queues, crons
* SSL via Let's Encrypt
* App deployment from Git (coming soon)

---

## 🧪 Project Status

Razor is in **early preview** — usable, evolving, and open to contributions. Production use is possible, but expect rapid changes.

---

## 💡 Philosophy

Modern server panels charge monthly, hide features, or force vendor ecosystems.

Razor is different:

* Built for devs who want freedom
* Free to use and open source
* Premium features may come later — core stays free

Help shape it:

* ⭐ Star the repo
* 🧑‍💻 Contribute ideas or code
* 🍕 GitHub Sponsors (coming soon)

## 🛠 Installation

```bash

Or clone the repo and run `install.sh`.
